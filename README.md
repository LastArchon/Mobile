##Journal Pages

A journal that allows the player to learn more about the locations and characters they encounter, as well as the enemies they defeat.

This is going to be placed into a companion app that can be used along with the game.
# Purpose
The purpose of this companion app is to have a extra tool that the player can use to get immersed in the game if they so choose. 
Rather than forcing heavy dialogue into the in-game menus and cluttering the interface, it can remain simple by having the more frivolous features be in the companion app. 
The **main** feature that the app has will be giving the player the feeling of being a traveler with a journal, jotting down notes and information that they uncover about enemies and locations. 
The player will also have access to a world map within the companion app, allowing them to find themselves if they got lost. 
The idea that the map will be a hassle to open and close on your phone whenever you need it is present, however, ideally the player will begin to memorise the locations that they are progressing through, and begin to become more familiar with the world, allowing them to intuitively find their way.

# Appearance
